# UpCommerce Ticketing System: Taming the Toil
Gemini (https://g.co/gemini/share/4ef6ca8d6a1c)

This document outlines strategies to tackle the ever-present challenge of toil within UpCommerce's ticketing system. Our goal is to streamline operations, ensuring only actionable alerts reach the engineers, and ultimately, improve the experience for both the team and our customers.

## Reducing Alert Overload
**Alert Triage**: We'll embark on a comprehensive review of the past three months' alerts, categorizing them into critical, actionable alerts and those generating non-actionable noise. User stories will be created to address critical alerts and eliminate unnecessary notifications.

**Automating the Mundane**: We'll identify alerts that can be automated, crafting user stories to establish automated responses for these common occurrences. This frees engineers from repetitive tasks and allows them to focus on more complex issues.
## Prioritization for Efficiency
*Leveraging PagerDuty*: To elevate incident management, we'll integrate tools like PagerDuty. This integration will enable features like:
- *Seamless Integration*: Connecting monitoring tools like New Relic (metric-based alerts) and Splunk (log-based alerts) to provide a centralized view of incidents.
- *Smart Prioritization*: Prioritizing incidents based on urgency and impact, ensuring critical issues receive immediate attention.
- *Clear Escalation Paths*: Defining escalation protocols for incidents that require intervention from higher tiers within the engineering team.
- *Detailed Reporting*: Generating comprehensive incident reports to facilitate post-mortem analysis and identify areas for improvement.
  
## Beyond Alerts: Enhancing the Overall Experience
**Knowledge is Power**: We'll create and maintain up-to-date runbooks for on-call engineers, providing them with a quick reference guide for handling incidents. Additionally, mock drills will be conducted to ensure preparedness.
- *Self-Service Solutions*: We'll explore implementing self-service options, such as chatbots, to empower users to resolve common issues independently. This reduces the burden on the support team.
- *User Empowerment*: A well-maintained, comprehensive user guide will be readily available to users, minimizing the need for them to submit tickets for basic questions or tasks.
- *Continuous Improvement*: We'll establish a feedback loop to gather insights from both engineers and users. This continuous feedback will help us identify and address pain points, fostering an ongoing process of improvement for the ticketing system.

By implementing these strategies, we aim to significantly reduce toil within the UpCommerce ticketing system. This will lead to faster incident resolution, improved engineer productivity, and a more positive experience for our valued customers.
